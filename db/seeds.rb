# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# User.create([
#         {first_name: "hannah", last_name: "r", email: "hannah@gmail.com", username: "h_annah", password: "test"},
#         {first_name: "amanda", last_name: "m", email: "amanda@gmail.com", username: "A_manda", password: "test"},
#         {first_name: "erick", last_name: "b", email: "erick@gmail.com", username: "e_rick", password: "test"}
#     ])

# 10.times do
#     first_name = Faker::Name.first_name
#     last_name = Faker::Name.last_name
#     email = Faker::Internet.email
#     username = Faker::Internet.username
#     password = Faker::Internet.password
#     User.create(first_name: first_name, last_name: last_name, email: email, username: username, password: password)

# 20.times do

#     address = Faker::Address.full_address
#     phone_number = Faker::PhoneNumber.cell_phone
#     Venue.create(name: name, address: address, phone_number: phone_number)
